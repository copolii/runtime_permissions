# MARSHMALLOW RUNTIME PERMISSIONS
One of the most talked about features of Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) was the finer permission controls, known as ‘Runtime Permissions’. Runtime Permissions allow the user to control whether a certain app has access to confidential data such as user’s contacts. Users can also take back permissions that they’ve already granted.

This git repo is the demo code for my #androidyvr talk on Android Marshmallow Runtime Permissions. The slides and the write up to go with it can be found [on my blog.](http://www.mahram.ca/marshmallow-runtime-permissions/)
